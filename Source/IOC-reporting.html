    <h2>what is an IOC ?</h2>
    <p>Indicators of compromise (IOCs) are “pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify
        potentially malicious activity on a system or network.” Indicators of compromise aid information security and IT professionals in
        detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity. By monitoring for indicators of compromise, organizations can
        detect attacks and act quickly to prevent breaches from occurring or limit damages by stopping attacks in earlier stages.

        Indicators of compromise act as breadcrumbs that lead infosec and IT pros to detect malicious activity early in the attack sequence.
        These unusual activities are the red flags that indicate a potential or in-progress attack that could lead to a data breach or
        systems compromise. But, IOCs are not always easy to detect; they can be as simple as metadata elements or incredibly complex
        malicious code and content samples. Analysts often identify various IOCs to look for correlation and piece them together to analyze
        a potential threat or incident.</p>

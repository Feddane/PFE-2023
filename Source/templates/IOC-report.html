            <p>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are pieces of information that can help detect and identify potential security threats or

            <p>By collecting and analyzing IOCs reports, security professionals can identify patterns and trends in attacks and develop
                strategies
                to protect against future threats. these reports will be shared within the security community to improve threat intelligence
                and
                response efforts.</p>

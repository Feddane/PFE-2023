    <h2>what is a cybercrime ?</h2>
    <p>Cybercrime refers to criminal activities that are carried out using a computer or an online network. These criminal activities may
        include fraud, online image abuse, shopping and investment scams, ransomware or malware attacks, identity theft, as well as threats
        and intimidation.</p>
    <p>As cyber crime becomes more sophisticated, criminals are targeting individuals, businesses, critical infrastructure organisations,
        education institutes and governments agencies or departments.</p>
